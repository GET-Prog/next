This repository contains a website that the GETPro group uses to define the `Next` studies' and presentations'  themes.

## How to run it

First of all, put your firebase credentials at `database.js`.

As this project does not use any package manager, you are good to go! Just start an HTTP server at the root of this project and access it.

If you have `python` a simple way to do that is running this command:
```bash
$ python -m http.server # For Python 3
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer # For Python 2
```
